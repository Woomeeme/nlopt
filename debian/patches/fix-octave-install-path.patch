Description: Fix installation path of Octave files
 Without this patch, the Octave files would be installed in a path that contains
 the version number of the Octave version against which they were compiled.
 Thus, the package would need to be recompiled after each new (minor) version of
 Octave.
 The present patch makes the installation path independent from the Octave
 version (of course, rebuilds may still be needed because of ABI bumps).
